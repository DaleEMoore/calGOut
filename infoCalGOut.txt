TODOs
Sometimes errors when running, like We 19 Nov 2014 8:40 AM CST.
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "C:/Users/dalem/PycharmProjects/calGOut/main.py", line 75, in get_events
        google_calendar_fetcher.get_calendars(token, start_date, end_date, search_string, destination_file)
      File "C:\Users\dalem\PycharmProjects\calGOut\google_calendar_fetcher.py", line 59, in get_calendars
        "Can't get calendars list (network error?)"
    AssertionError: Can't get calendars list (network error?)

Correct the discrepancy between Google Calendar and calGOut.
    Look at Dale's Excel spreadsheet on Buba for discrepancies.

At completion of importing Google Calendar Events, open .CSV with Spreadsheet application.

Change output t1.csv to calGOut.csv

Change output to only include important, useful fields.

Check on "bill" as last word in description, not found on Tue 11 Nov 2014 6:30 PM
    "Email Joann questions power off bu server effect and bu server admin own, email pace Bill"

Check that items on the ending date appear. Tue 11 Nov 2014 "Bill mrs for anti virus, update mal ware bytes" didn't.
    Maybe it's because it's the first word?

Create install/setup?
