Overview
Calendar Google Out to Quick Books, Quicken, OpenERP, Odoo or some other invoicing program.

Keep your scheduled events in Google Calendar, perform the events, then bill for the time.
get and install google gdata.

DEV; in pyCharm run main.py.

python27\scripts\pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
https://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/downloads/list

How do I implement code?
    Find google_calendar_API_v3_1.pyc and copy to production?
    Copy to smb://192.168.1.2/c$/Shares/Shared/Access/InvoiceExports
    Backup google_calendar_API_v3_1.py and .pyc to C:\Users\dalem\PycharmProjects\calGOut\old
    Then move to C:\Users\dalem\PycharmProjects\calGOut
    Try it.



TODOs
Installed new development environment and now get:
    ERROR: Missing module - cannot import name run
    https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli/issues/204
    Looks like I need to anchor
        oauth2client==1.4.12
        in requirements.txt and things look better.
    authentication via google chrome.
    Getting lots of:
** Message: received an invalid or unencryptable secret
[16115:16472:1207/085404.284057:ERROR:native_backend_libsecret.cc(530)] Unable to load secret itemReceived invalid secret from the secret storage
    Running fine now without errors. I think it MIGHT BE because of the authorization.
    Implement this code, or run at Buba and see if it works?
    Run at Buba from terminal
        X:\Scripts\calGOut\main.py
        Same error 'returned "Not Found"'.
        Check Firefox, default browser, has google calendar access.
        From CMD URL https://calendar.google.com it works FINE.

        Thu 7 Dec 2017 9:15 AM CST
        calGOut.py has problems accessing data.
        Gets "Not Found" on the following:
        https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/jq6pbp8iau4bbii47ri5lk6ue8%40group.calendar.google.com/events?timeMax=2017-12-07T00%3A00%3A00-06%3A00&alt=json&singleEvents=true&timeMin=2017-11-30T00%3A00%3A00-06%3A00
        But Firefox gives me:
            {
             "error": {
              "errors": [

            daleemoore 		daleemoore
        Both have one member, DaleEMoore@gMail.Com.
        See if calGOut references api-project-936484003082 or daleemoore projects.
        api-project-936484003082 does not seem to be anywhere in the calGOut project.
        So how does this authentication work?
        Do I need to upgrade to a newer version of oauth?

        What does "Daily Limit for Unauthenticated Use Exceeded. Continued use requires signup." have to say for itself?
        Look for googleapis.com in code... 6 matches in 5 files.
        See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19335503/keep-getting-a-daily-limit-for-unauthenticated-use-exceeded-continued-use-requ for other information.

        It looks like it's re-authorizing on each workstation (QnD, Mercury, Buba.)
        What is the correct or easy way to upgrade Buba to the latest code?
            PyCharm upgrade?

Should I have an authorization mode for calGOut?
    It looks like it's doing that automatically with the new code.

Why is the field ents undefined in the current code?
    Did previous copies of the code have a valid definition for the field ents?
    Though UNDEFINED, the code seems to run fine... why is that?

    Try except error and display which calendar description is failing.
    I MIGHT have fixed the problem, but; it doesn't display that there was a data error; I think. So I've commented
    out the code and expect that when I encounter the next data error I will be able to make it display.

Make the code self-updating except when (major.minor.miniscule) major or minor? changes.

Save the default values so it's customized to the installed instance.

Launch it from a Desktop ICON.
    Python Launcher for Windows (Console) Python Software Foundation.
    (Instead of python.exe.) It looks like it's launching idea.

Shifting from command-line date strings to calculated last-2-weeks date strings is failing.
    Figure out how to get last-2-weeks into command-line acceptible format.

Make main.py run it.
Change tkinter options page to have key fields.

oauth2client.client.AccessTokenRefreshError: invalid_grant
    Trying to fix a bug when running as guest1@Mercury.
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23918443/got-invalid-grant-in-oauth2-signedjwtassertioncredentials
    This MIGHT been because I'd not git pull-ed the most recent code.
    Fixed buy git pull-ing the most recent code!

Ran DEV on Windows, ran fine, without error.
Then ran LIVE on Windows, still no problem. I'm assuming that the DEV installation improved the package support on Windows perhaps with new versions.

Try it again... No error this time. Something at Google or on Buba during programs startup?
